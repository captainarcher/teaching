## Course Policies

### Table 4: Grade Scale

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| A | 90.0 - 100.0 |
| B | 80.0 - 89.9 |
| C | 70.0 - 79.9 |
| D | 60.0 - 69.9 |
| F | 59.9 or below |

While grades are important in college, they become less important over time. It's important for students to not solely fixate on the grades and instead take advantage of the learning opportunities and skills development necessary for the workplace. The assignments and policies in this course strike a balance between these two types of outcomes. If you focus entirely on your grade, then you will have missed out on significant learning opportunities.

### Instructor's Grading and Late Policies:

Failure is a tool that enables self-improvement and therefore, I have enacted the following grading policies that are unique to my course. These are applicable equally to all students in my course.

Any student may optionally submit Critical Thinking Assignments and the Final Project early for substantive feedback. The feedback will tell you how to improve your submission before receiving a grade. Early submissions will only receive substantive feedback, not a grade. Grades will only be assigned once after the due date has passed. You are not required to consider or implement my feedback, nor are you required to resubmit your assignment. If you have not resubmitted the assignment by the due date, then your original submission will be graded. It is in your best interest to submit assignments as early as possible, to provide you with an opportunity to incorporate the constructive feedback into your final submission.

- Critical Thinking Assignments must be submitted by Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. MT of the week prior to the due date to receive feedback. Your final submission must be made by the due date.
- The Final project must be submitted by Monday at 11:59p.m. of the week prior to the due date to receive feedback. Your final submission must be made by the due date.

Life can sometimes throw us curveballs and I am ill-equipped to judge others on the merit of their situations. Therefore, I have enacted the following flexible grading policy for all students.

- Any student may replace your lowest two quiz scores (whether a zero from a missed quiz or just a score that you are unhappy with) by completing up to two makeup assignments. The makeup assignment will consist of completing a hands-on activity and written report. **You must request your makeup assignment(s) at the start of Week 7 and complete them by the end of Week 7. These are NOT automatic.**
- The Quizzes, Midterm Exam, and Final Project may NOT be submitted late.
- You may submit Critical Thinking Assignments up to four full days late. The penalties are as follows:
  - by Monday 11:59 p.m. MT = 4 points penalty subtracted from your score
  - by Tuesday 11:59 p.m. MT = 8 points penalty subtracted from your score
  - by Wednesday 11:59 p.m. MT = 12 points penalty subtracted from your score
  - by Thursday 11:59 p.m. MT = 20 points penalty subtracted from your score
  - No assignments will be accepted after Thursday 11:59 p.m. MT

If you are unable to hand in an assignment due to a valid excuse, you must provide adequate documentation to certify the valid excuse. 

### Assignment Completion
All assignments are individual assignments and you may not work on the written, quiz, or exam portions of them in groups. With that being said, team work is a valuable skill and I encourage you to form informal study groups to prepare for the midterm exam and to work through challenges on hands-on activities. In my past courses, students self-formed small groups to work on the hands-on activities, working through problems, and learning together. When it was time to complete the written portion of the assignment, that was for individuals to work on independently. While it is not required to form these virtual study groups, it is encouraged.

### Participation
- Prompt and consistent attendance in your online courses is essential for your success at CSU-Pueblo Online. Failure to verify your attendance within the first 7 days of this course may result in your withdrawal. If for some reason you would like to drop a course, please contact your advisor.
- Online classes have deadlines, assignments, and participation requirements just like on-campus classes. Budget your time carefully and keep an open line of communication with your instructor. If you are having technical problems, problems with your assignments, or other problems that are impeding your progress, let your instructor know as soon as possible.

### Use of Technology

- This is a 100% online course. Therefore, reliable internet service is required.  Blackboard (https://blackboard.lms.csupueblo.edu/) is a Web-based learning management system (LMS). You can find necessary course documents and readings on Blackboard. You will also find important announcements and updates about the course. Thus, it is important to access and check Blackboard regularly.
- If you have any IT issues, call the IT desk at: 719-549-2002. They are available 8-5 MST M-F. Contact your instructor to notify them if you are experiencing issues contacting them.
- As a student at CSU Pueblo, you have a university-provided email. For authentication purposes, instructors will only communicate with students over email via the university’s email system. You are expected to check your university-provided email regularly.
- We may utilize a variety of other systems in this course which will be provided at no cost for education-related usage. I will provide appropriate information as part of the assignment. Please read the instructions carefully.
- I may share information about optional technologies that you may wish to explore on your own, but are not required for your assignments. You are not required to use these.

### Generative AI Policy
We will utilize AI tools for specific hands-on activities, however, the following general university policy applies in this course. If a specific assignment permits the use of AI, it will be explicitly stated in the instructions. 

Any work written, developed, created, or inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) is considered plagiarism and will not be tolerated. While the ever-changing (and exciting!) new developments with AI will find their place in our workforces and personal lives, it does not belong in our classroom. This is because AI robs us of all the opportunity to develop self-awareness and other emotional intelligence skills, learn from our experiences and from each other, personalize content to problem-solve, and contribute our ideas in authentic ways. College is a place for learning and developing critical thinking skills, and this class is specifically a space for learning how to strengthen our skills and improve our weaknesses, to more effectively compete in today’s workplaces; AI cannot do that for us.

### Student email and FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
In order to maintain confidentiality, students must use their CSU Pueblo email address to correspond with their instructor, especially if requesting academic information.

### Netiquette
Students engaging in an online class at CSU Pueblo must respect the diversity of opinions of the instructor and their classmates, engaging with them in a courteous, respectful, and professional manner. The time spent in this classroom is meant to be productive for everyone, and all posts and classroom communication must be conducted in accordance with the student code of conduct.  Think before you submit or send anything. Question whether you said what you meant or how the person or people who read your words will interpret them.

You must maintain an environment free from harassment, stalking, threats, abuse, insults, or humiliation toward your instructor and classmates. This includes, but is not limited to, demeaning written or oral comments regarding ethnicity/race, religion, age, disability, sex/gender, or sexual orientation. Unwanted sexual advances or intimidations by email, or on discussion boards or other postings within or connected to the online classroom, is prohibited. If you are the victim of any of these behaviors or witness these behaviors toward your classmates or instructor, please report it immediately: [Student Complaint/Concern Resolution Process] (https://www.csupueblo.edu/campus-life/student-complaint-form.html)
